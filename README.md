# Small projects 
I am a Python programmer and have been coding for 3 months now. I consider myself a beginner amateur and usually spend 1-3 hours per day coding. If you notice anything that could be improved, please let me know. Would you like to code together? Feel free to reach out to me on Instagram: Medi.207
